      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Netdata.
Netdata is a daemon which runs on your device(s) collecting data in real time. It has a very nice interface and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to see your devices from anywhere with Netdata Cloud (once you add your nodes into it).
For monitoring there are a lot of tools which are great like Nagios, Icinga, Prometheus, etc but this one is really easy to install and use from home without doing a lot of stuff.</description>
