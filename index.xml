      <description>Along with my OMV (OpenMediaVault) setup with a Raspberry Pi and a couple of SSD drives, I have a Synology NAS which really makes your life easier.
Setup First of all, you need to put either a single 3.5&amp;quot; or 2.5&amp;quot; drive inside the Synology before starting it.
After that, you can browse and search your NAS on:
 find.synology.com synologynas:5000  This will take a little bit until it finds your NAS and it will display a web page with some basic data about your new device and the status which is really important that says &amp;ldquo;Not Installed&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Netdata.
Netdata is a daemon which runs on your device(s) collecting data in real time. It has a very nice interface and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to see your devices from anywhere with Netdata Cloud (once you add your nodes into it).
For monitoring there are a lot of tools which are great like Nagios, Icinga, Prometheus, etc but this one is really easy to install and use from home without doing a lot of stuff.</description>

      <title>First Post</title>

      <description>Welcome!
The idea behind this blog is to keep track of whatever I&amp;rsquo;m testing at home. I will probably start with how did the setup of HUGO for the blog which is pretty much straight forward to be honest.
Learning curve I really expect to have a huge learning curve just because I&amp;rsquo;ve never done such a thing and also because I&amp;rsquo;m a real &amp;ldquo;test and failure&amp;rdquo; person!
Most common topics  rpi open source packages monitoring NAS NFS SMB Sync the phone on the NAS Big etc!</description>
