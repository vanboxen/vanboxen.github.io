      <description>Welcome!
The idea behind this blog is to keep track of whatever I&amp;rsquo;m testing at home. I will probably start with how did the setup of HUGO for the blog which is pretty much straight forward to be honest.

Most common topics  rpi open source packages monitoring NAS NFS SMB Sync the phone on the NAS Big etc!</description>
