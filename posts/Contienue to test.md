# Welcome to blogd
This will be a blog where I will put whatever I'm trying to install/test at home.

# What are we going to use
 - HUGO to create something fast and simple. 
- Stackedit to edit MD files on the fly.
- Github pages to keep everything online 

I will explain later how to install HUGO locally, pick a theme to use and install it. I must say that it was very simple.

I've spend a couple of hours trying to make it run on dockers on portainer.io but since the setup is running on a rpi it was not really possible.

Although, Ghost was working fine and I still have a live version I believe that HUGO is simpler.
