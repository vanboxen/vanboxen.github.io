# Welcome to blogd
This will be a blog where I will put whatever I'm trying to install/test at home.

# What are we going to use
Mostly HUGO to create something fast and simple. 
Stackedit to edit MD files on the fly with the Github pages sync.
Finally, Github pages to keep everything online without the need of reinventing the wheel.

# Synchronization
Later I will explain how to install HUGO locally, pick a theme to use and install it. I must say that it was very simple.
I've spend a couple of hours trying to make it run on dockers on portainer.io but since the setup is running on a rpi it was not really possible.

Ghost was working fine and I still have a live version there but I belive that HUGO is simpler.
