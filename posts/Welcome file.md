# HowTO install HUGO

## Must have
brew
git


You will need first to have brew installed on your device so make sure that is up and running. Then from linux/mac just open the terminal and install HUGO.

    brew install hugo

If everything was fine just check it with:

    hugo version

Now a days is common to have git preinstalled by default. Anyway, if you need to check if the package is already there there then:

    git --version

Otherwise, use your favorite package manager to install it if it's not already there. For example:

    zypper install git

Hurray! We have

## Learning curve

I really expect to have a huge learning curve just because I've never done such a thing and also because I'm a real "test and failure" person!
