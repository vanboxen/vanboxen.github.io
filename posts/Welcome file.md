# Welcome to blogd
This will be an easy blog where I can put whatever I'm trying to install.

# What are we going to use
Mostly HUGO to create something fast and simple. 
Stackedit to edit MD files on the fly with the github pages sync.
Finally, Github pages to keep everything online without a lot of problems.

# Synchronization
Later I will explain how to install HUGO locally, pick a theme to use and install
