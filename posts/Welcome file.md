# HowTO install HUGO

## Must have
brew
git


You will need first to have brew installed on your device so make sure that is up and running. Then from linux/mac just open the terminal and install HUGO.

    brew install hugo

If everything was fine just check it with:

    hugo version

Now, you just need git on your device. Use your favorite package manager to install it if it's not already there.

    zypper install git

Now a days is common to have it preinstalled by default.

## Learning curve

I really expect to have a huge learning curve just because I've never done such a thing and also because I'm a real "test and failure" person!
