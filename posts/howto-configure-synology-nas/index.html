Setup First of all, you need to put either a single 3.5&quot; or 2.5&quot; drive inside the Synology before starting it.
After that, you can browse and search your NAS on find.synology.com or synologynas:5000. This will take a little bit until it finds your NAS and it will display a web page with some basic data about your new device and the status which is really important that says &ldquo;Not Installed&rdquo;.">
