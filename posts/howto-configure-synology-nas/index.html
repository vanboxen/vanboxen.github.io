<p>First of all, you need to put either a single 3.5&quot; or 2.5&quot; drive inside the Synology before starting it.</p>

<p>Then, click &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; at the bottom and that will start the DSM installation and setup process.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-poolvolume">Creating a Pool/Volume<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#creating-a-poolvolume">#</a></h2>
<p>The new prompt will tell you to setup a Storage Pool and Volume.</p>
<p>The wizard will guide you and is pretty much intuitive. You will need to define a description for the pool and select a RAID or not, this options are up to you and what do you want to do with the NAS.</p>
<p>Select the drives that you want to use (usually all of them). In any case, it&rsquo;s always possible to add more resources to the pool.</p>
<p>Then, there will be a message saying that the data will be wipped from the drives and if you like to perform a drive checks. The last one, will take a very long time but it can run in the background while you are doing other stuff.</p>

<p>Two things are really important here,</p>
<ul>
<li>encryption option</li>
<li>users/ permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you lose your encryption key, then your data is lost forever. Also, with this option you can easily face slowness in your transfers.</p>
<p>Users and permissions, the best is to keep everything aligned with different users. I mean, if you use SMB and NFS, create one user for SMB and another one for NFS. Same, if you later install docker and you use containers.</p>

<p>There are tons of things to do, you can use containers with dockers, create snapshots of folder, use versioning for files, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also nice to use an external DNS for your NAS to reach it from outside which is a free service from Synology and super easy to setup. If you go in that direction, you will probably end up using a couple of containers to use some services outside your home/office so always keep an eye on the firewall settings. Have fun!</p>
